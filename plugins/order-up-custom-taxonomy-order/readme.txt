== Description ==

Order Up!

A series of plugins for WordPress which allow for the ordering of pages, posts, and taxonomies through a simple 
drag-and-drop interface using the available WordPress scripts and styles. The plugins are extremely lightweight, 
without a bunch of unnecessary scripts to load into the admin. They also fall in line gracefully with the look 
and feel of the WordPress interface.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Order posts from the Term Order menu in the admin
4. Optionally set whether or not to have queries of the selected taxonomy be sorted by this order automatically.
5. Optionally set `'orderby' => 'term_order', 'order => 'ASC'` to manually sort queries by this order.
